    Hi I am srivignesh. I have completed my HSC. I am Here to share my <u>12th life</u>
    <p>
        In my 12th life I have spent my hole life to my <b>School</b>. Far I cant say that I have not spent time with my friends<br> In my life the most precious time is for my friends. We will go together to the shop which is near of our school block. We have spent more time in the shop. We spend money together,if any of my friends has no money,me and my friend will put their funds too and we never ask them to return the money back. In my 12th life I never take book the book in my home before I'm to tuition.I have joined a Tuition names Success Tuition Center after my Quaterly exam completed. After my quaterly exam result was came.After I have got fear about my 12 public exam when my tuition teacher.So after the weekly test was introduced in our school. daily the exam is in our first period.In the weekend the result will be updated to our parent's phone.My dad used to update the result to my tuition teacher. weekly sundays the test willbe there in my tuition.Usually in starting there is a good performance and there is a good frame for me.After some months, I think December There is performance drop in me I cant able to study there is a too many to study. My tuition teacher beat me and challenged me you cant pass in maths in the next exam. But i have passed in maths in that exam with 70 marks I have taken the exam paper to my tuition teacher, but he does not believed that I have got 70 marks because I have not passed in the tuition test,for past few weeks. After I have got head weight. So again I have got low marks in maths. After, the public exam has come.</p>

                In my 12th i have read about the basics of <u>python and mySQL</u> it is useful to read in our computer then i have realised that the basics is more important to complete the advanced python programming language.And i have studied about  oxygen in Chemistry. Nowadays in all the smart watches there is a feature called spO2 meter to check the blood oxygen level.
