    Salem is one <b>Ancient</b> place in <i>tamilnadu</i> which has ruled by all the three emperor <u> chera,chola,pandyas
    <p>
        During the third century BCE, there was the period of Bogar – a notable Tamil Siddhar, and at that time Jainism and Buddhism arrived. Around the beginning of the common era, the existence of a culturally and economically advanced society in Salem two thousand years ago is evident from the discovery of silver coins of the Roman Emperor Tiberices Claudices Nero (37–68 CE) in Koneripatti of Salem in 1987. Later, the Pandya dynasty started ruling the region around Salem. Afterwards, the Pallava dynasty arose in Salem, followed by Mahendra Varma Pallava coming to Salem and the rise of Saivite principles. Mahendra Varma Pallava was succeeded by Narasimha Varma Pallava. Soon, the Pandya dynasty ruled over Salem. The Hoysala rule established in Salem and parts around Salem was retained under the Pandya dynasty.
